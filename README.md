Interruption Junction
============

Interruption Junction is a short one-button conversation game about being lonely in a group of people. Click repeatedly or mash the spacebar to interrupt.

This project uses CreateJS (http://createjs.com/) and Kate Compton's Tracery library (https://github.com/galaxykate/tracery).

TinyArchae Edition
=============
